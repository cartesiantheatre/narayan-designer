    Narayan Designer is a cross platform tool used to create agent based
    simulation models for the Narayan simulation engine. 

    The Narayan simulation engine can be embedded within a variety of creative
    applications. These might range from an urban dynamics simulator assisting
    city planners manage a real city to a game. A simulation model defines the
    world's agents, resources, maps, units, globals, and simulation rules.

    Simulation rules are written using Narayan Logic. Narayan Logic is an easy
    to use stateless declarative language. Rules are executed atomically at
    regular cycle intervals to update the state of the simulation.

    By allowing simulation designers to visualize their model, it becomes easier
    for non-technical subject matter experts to contribute to their
    construction.

    Narayan Designer uses a graphical Gtk+ based user interface via the C++
    Gtkmm bindings. The Narayan simulation engine is used in Avaneya, a cerebral
    science fiction metropolis city builder social simulation.

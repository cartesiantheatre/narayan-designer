    Narayan Designer is a portable design tool used to create agent based
    simulation models for the Narayan simulation engine. The latter can be
    embedded within a variety of creative applications. These might range from
    urban dynamic simulators assisting city planners manage a real city all the
    way to a science fiction metropolis city builder social simulation on
    another planet.

    Narayan Designer uses a graphical Gtk+ based user interface. Models define
    agents, resources, maps, units, globals, and simulation rules. 

    Simulation rules are written using Narayan Logic. Narayan Logic is an easy
    to use stateless declarative language. Simulation rules are executed
    atomically at regular cycle intervals to update the state of the simulation.
